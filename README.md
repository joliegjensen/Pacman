# Pacman

## Description
This program allows users to bring the beloved character to life! First, click on "Add Pacman". Each click will add another, with no limit, so users should add as many as they'd like! Then, when ready, click "Start Game", and the Pacmen will begin moving around the screen!

## How to Run
Click on "Add Pacman" (at least once, or as many time's as you'd like), and then click "Start Game".

## Roadmap of Future Improvements
I think an interesting update to make would be to update Pacman's appearance. (Allow users to choose from Pacman, Ms Pacman, one of the ghosts, etc.)

## License Information
This project was made for the MIT XPro coding bootcamp, all updates were made by me.
